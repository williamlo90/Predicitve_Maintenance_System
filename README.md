# 🚀 Predictive Maintenance System With CI / CD 

An end-to-end predictive maintenance system combining machine learning with MLOps practices for scalable, production-ready deployment.

## 🔧 Key Components

- **Version Control**: GitHub used for collaboration and code management.
- **Environment Setup**: Reproducible Python environment using `virtualenv` and `requirements.txt`.
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of data ingestion, transformation, model training, and prediction.

## 🧠 ML Workflow

- **Data Processing**: Efficient pipelines using `dataclasses` and `scikit-learn`.
- **EDA & Feature Engineering**: In-depth analysis and custom features to boost model performance.
- **Modeling**: Multiple ML models trained with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Real-time inference capability with strong performance metrics.

## ⚙️ MLOps Integration

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated with GitHub Actions for testing, building, and deployment.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized app ensuring consistent environments.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Integrated with AWS EC2 and ECR for scalable deployment.

## 🌐 Web App Interface

- **Flask App**: Backend connected to an interactive frontend.
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design with HTML/CSS for easy user interaction.
